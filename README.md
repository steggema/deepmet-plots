### DeepMET simulation performance plots

Very simple:
- Input: CMS NanoAOD input files
- Output: DeepMET performance plots (resolution as function of some variable), comparing with Puppi and PF MET
- Requirements: uproot, matplotlib, mplhep (for plot style) + scipy, numpy, awkward (which should come with the former)
